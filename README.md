# Dalek Game in 3D
Daleks is a classic computer game played on a rectangular grid between a human character (“The Doctor”) controlled by the player and a number of robot-like characters (“Daleks”) controlled by the computer. (According to Wikipedia, the Daleks are “the mutated descendants of the Kaled people of the planet Skaro” who “travel around in tank-like mechanical casings”.)
